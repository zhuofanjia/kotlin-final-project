**Project Overview**

The goal of our project is to create a website by ktor and kotlin to share information about COVID-19. 
* The real-time data of cases in US by JHU
* The real-time data of cases in Champaign
* The link to COVID-19 website of UIUC
...

**Background**

The spread of Covid-19 has become a global crisis, making a big difference to our daily life. 
From the Internet, people can get access to the data of real time cases and other tips of 
preventing Covid-19. The government and our university also implement new policies and update 
information about covid-19 on their website. However, these websites are always separated and 
unrelated to each other. Our goal is to make it more convenient for people to follow up the 
information about Covid-19 updated everyday.

**What we did**

We first collected the link of three websites that I check everyday to get information of Covid-19
: the real-time data of cases in the US by JHU, the real-time data of cases in Champaign, and the 
website of Covid-19 created by UIUC. Then we implemented Ktor into our code and it can help us get
 the information quickly by tying the key words like “real time cases” in our port in google. The 
 website would directly jump to the website matched the key words set before. In that case, people
  can get the accurate information about covid-19 more efficiently. What’s more, if demanded, it 
  would be also easy to add more keywords and website links.
